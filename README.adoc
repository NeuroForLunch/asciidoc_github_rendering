.Inline markup
* _underlines around a phrase make the text italics_
* *astericks around a phrase make the text bold*
* double astericks around one or more le**t**ters in a word make those letters bold
* double underscore around a __sub__string in a word emphasizes that substring
* use carrots^ around characters to make them ^super^script
* use tildes~ around characters to make them ~sub~script
ifdef::basebackend-html[* to pass through +++<b>HTML</b>+++ directly, surround the text with triple plus]
ifdef::basebackend-docbook[* to pass through +++<constant>XML</constant>+++ directly, surround the text with triple plus]

// separate two adjacent lists using a line comment (only the leading // is required)

- characters can be escaped using a {backslash}
* for instance, you can escape a quote inside emphasized text like _that\'s cool!_
- you can safely use reserved XML characters like <, > and &, which are escaped when converting
- force a space{sp}between inline elements using the \{sp} attribute
- hold text together with a non-breaking{nbsp}space attribute, \{nbsp}

=== Lists

** second level
*** third level
- fourth level
* back to first level

In <<ordered>> that you can change the numbering style.
